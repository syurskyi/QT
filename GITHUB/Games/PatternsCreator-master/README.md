# PatternsCreator
## A PyQt5 tool to make patterns for a game

To run the tool, just run the main.py python file:
```
python3 main.py
```

The ui has been created with the QtDesigner (QtCreator). It has then been compiled to a python class using `pyuic5`. In order to recompile it, you may need to run
```
pyuic5 -o main_window.py ui/main_window.ui
```
