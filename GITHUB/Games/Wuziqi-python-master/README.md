# Wuziqi-python
A classic Chinese game, based on PyGame&amp;PyQt5

## Overview

Wuziqi, also known as Gomoku, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15Ã—15 grid intersections normally. Because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Wuziqi may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
