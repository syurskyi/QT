# Machine Learning GUI Application

This is an application made for those who want to build their machine learning models in seconds without writing a single line of code!

The user just have to browse the dataset(which should be in csv format), set the hyperparameters to appropriate values and hit 'Run'. 

The model will be automatically trained and get tested on the testing data. The results(precesion, recall, accuracy and f1 score) and confusion matrix is shown at the end. 

This application will reduce the time in fine-tuning the model and avoid repetitive change in code. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqb-j5lbFbw) is a small demo of how to use the application.
