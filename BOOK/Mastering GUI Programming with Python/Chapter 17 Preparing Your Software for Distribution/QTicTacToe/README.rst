About
=====

This is the classic game of **tic-tac-toe**, also known as noughts and crosses.  Battle your opponent in a desperate race to get three in a line.

Usage
=====

Simply run `python qtictactoe.py` from within the project folder.

- Players take turns clicking the mouse on the playing field to mark squares.
- When one player gets 3 in a row, they win.
- If the board is filled with nobody getting in a row, the game is a draw.

Notes
=====

    A strange game.  The only winning move is not to play.
